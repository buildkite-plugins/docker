# Docker Buildkite Plugin ![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/3a4b0903b26c979f265c049c932fb4ff3c055af7a199a17216.svg)

A [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) plugin for running pipeline steps in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers

The `buildkite-agent` command line tool (and required environment variables) will also be mounted into the container, allowing you to use it for artifact download, etc.

If you need more control, please see the [docker-compose Buildkite Plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/docker-compose-buildkite-plugin).

The docker container has the host buildkite-agent binary mounted in to `/usr/bin/buildkite-agent` and the required environment variables set.

## Example

The following pipeline will run `yarn install` and `yarn run test` inside a Docker container using the [node:7 Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/):

```yml
steps:
  - command: yarn install && yarn run test
    plugins:
      docker#v1.1.1:
        image: "node:7"
        workdir: /app
```

You can pass in additional environment variables:

```yml
steps:
  - command: yarn install && yarn run test
    plugins:
      docker#v1.1.1:
        image: "node:7"
        workdir: /app
        environment:
          - MY_SPECIAL_VALUE=1
```

You can pass in additional volume mounts. This is useful for docker-in-docker:

```yml
steps:
  - command: docker build . -t image:tag
    plugins:
      docker#v1.1.1:
        image: "docker:latest"
        mounts:
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

You can specify a docker network to join. This will be created if it does not already exist:

```yml
steps:
  - command: docker build . -t image:tag
    plugins:
      docker#v1.1.1:
        image: "docker:latest"
        network: "test-network"
```

## Configuration

### `image` (required)

The name of the Docker image to use.

Example: `node:7`

### `workdir`(optional)

The working directory where the pipelineâ€™s code will be mounted to, and run from, inside the container. The default is `/workdir`.

Example: `/app`

### `srcdir` (optional)

The relative path to the source directory you wish to mount into the running container. The default is `./`.

Example: `./components/my-source`

### `always-pull` (optional)

Whether to always pull the latest image before running the command. Useful if the image has a `latest` tag. The default is false, the image will only get pulled if not present.

### `mount-buildkite-agent` (optional)

Whether to automatically mount the `buildkite-agent` binary from the host agent machine into the container. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` if you want to disable, or if you already have your own binary in the image.

### `mounts` (optional)

Extra volume mounts to pass to the docker container, in an array of `SOURCE:TARGET` params

Example: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

### `environment` (optional)

Extra environment variables to pass to the docker container, in an array of `KEY=VALUE` params.

Example: `MY_SPECIAL_VALUE=1`

### `user` (optional)

Allows a user to be set, and override the USER entry in the Dockerfile. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user for more details.

Example: `root`

### `network` (optional)

Join the container to the docker network specified. The network will be created if it does not already exist. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings for more details.

Example: `test-network`

### `debug` (optional)

Outputs the command to be run, and enables xtrace in the plugin

Example: `true`
